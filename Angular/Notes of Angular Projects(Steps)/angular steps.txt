1) create an angular project
2) open the project folder in vs code
3) delete all code in app component
4) create a login component using terminal
    ng g c login
5) plug this login component inside app component        (using selector)
6) run the project
    ng serve -o            (this we can do in another cmd prompt. so that it is always running)
